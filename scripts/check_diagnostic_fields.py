"""Diagnostic-field enforcement script (#682).

`spec/00-introduction.md` §0.5.1 ("Diagnostic Structure") says every
diagnostic MUST include an error code, a description, a rationale, a
fix, and a spec reference.  "Diagnostics as instructions" is a core
differentiator (DESIGN.md §"Checkability"), so this is a load-bearing
claim — yet the `Diagnostic` dataclass defaults `rationale`/`fix`/
`spec_ref`/`error_code` to `""`, so a partially-tagged diagnostic
compiles and ships silently.

This script makes "is every diagnostic fully tagged?" a mechanically
checkable contract, mirroring `scripts/check_walker_coverage.py`
(#597).  It AST-parses every `Diagnostic(...)` constructor and every
`self._error(...)` / `self._warning(...)` call under `vera/` and fails
if a required field is missing.  It also validates that every present
`spec_ref` resolves to a real spec section/chapter and that every
literal `error_code` is *registered* in `vera/errors.py` `ERROR_CODES`
(a cheap emission-side check; making each code *unique* per concept and
enforcing error_code presence are tracked in #828).

Design — explicit over implicit (DESIGN.md §"Explicitness over
convenience"; no silently-inferred exemptions):

- **Required by default:** ``rationale``, ``fix``, ``spec_ref`` on every
  site (the three content fields of spec §0.5.1, per #682's acceptance
  criteria; ``error_code`` enforcement is a tracked follow-up).  A field
  counts as present if its kwarg is a non-empty string literal, or any
  non-constant expression (a variable / f-string / concatenation
  threading the value through).
- **Severity rule:** a ``warning`` carries no corrected-code template,
  so ``fix`` is not required of warning-severity diagnostics.
- **Structural registry (`STRUCTURAL_EXEMPTIONS`):** the codegen
  ``_error`` / ``_warning`` helpers build internal-compiler (E699) and
  "function skipped" limitation diagnostics that have no user-facing
  fix or spec section.  These are exempt from ``fix`` / ``spec_ref`` —
  declared *once*, with a written reason, here.  A new helper or a new
  direct ``Diagnostic(...)`` defaults to fully-required until added.
- **Per-call opt-out:** ``# diag-fields-exempt: <reason>`` on the call,
  the reason mandatory — for one-off defensive / internal branches
  (e.g. an "unknown expression type" fallback).  A marker without a
  reason is itself a violation.  (A dedicated token, not a ruff-style
  suppression comment — see ``OPT_OUT`` below for why.)
- **Plumbing skip:** the *single* ``Diagnostic(...)`` an ``_error`` /
  ``_warning`` helper *method* constructs is not an independent site — its
  fields are threaded from the helper's parameters, so its call sites plus
  the registry govern it.  All three passes below honour the skip.
  Narrowed for #827: keying on the helper's *name* alone let a stray second
  ctor in the same helper (or a non-helper coincidentally named ``_error``)
  escape every pass.  The skip now requires (a) a genuine helper *method* —
  a class member with a ``self`` receiver, since every real helper is one, so
  a module-level function merely named ``_error`` is inspected, not exempted —
  (b) that the ctor is the method's **sole own-scope** construction, and (c)
  that the ctor is actually *reachable as the helper's result* — return-ed,
  appended, or bound to a local that is later return-ed/appended (#956).  A
  helper holding two constructions is ambiguous: neither is skipped, and both
  are inspected.  Counting *every* own-scope construction (not just the one
  structurally ``return``ed or ``.append(...)``-ed) is what makes (b) sound —
  see ``_own_scope_diag_ctors``.  "Own scope" is the helper's **body**:
  decorators, parameter defaults and annotations evaluate in the *enclosing*
  scope, so a ``Diagnostic(...)`` there is inspected, never elected.  Without
  (c), a helper that builds its sole ctor and hands it to something other
  than a return/append (e.g. ``self.dispatch(d)``) was wrongly elected as
  plumbing — see ``_ctor_is_reachable_as_result``.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_diagnostic_fields.py   # exit 0 if all sites
                                                # fully tagged; 1 + a
                                                # report otherwise.

Wired into pre-commit and the CI lint job so a new under-tagged
diagnostic added to `vera/` is rejected at the door.
