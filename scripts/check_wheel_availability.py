"""Verify all pinned runtime dependencies have wheels for supported platforms.

This is the structural backstop against the macOS 14 install regression
documented in #691: when an upstream dep bumps its platform-tag baseline,
this script fails fast in CI rather than letting users on older systems
discover the regression by hitting a cryptic source-build failure 20
minutes into ``pip install``.

The supported platforms checked by this script are the executable form of
the policy documented in README.md §Supported platforms.  If you want to
add or remove a supported platform, update both the policy text and the
SUPPORTED table below — they must agree.

What this checks:

- For each (platform tag, Python version) tuple in SUPPORTED,
  every runtime dependency declared in ``pyproject.toml`` resolves to a
  prebuilt wheel.  Anything that would fall back to source build (sdist)
  on the target platform is a failure.

What this does NOT check:

- Whether the wheel actually works end-to-end on the target platform.
  That is what running the CI matrix on the platform itself is for; see
  the ``test`` job in ``.github/workflows/ci.yml``.  This script is the
  cheaper proxy for the install step, run before the test matrix.

- The ``[dev]`` extras.  Those are dev tooling (pytest, mypy, ruff, etc.)
  and are typically pure Python; their platform-tag risk is much lower.

- Transitive dependencies.  ``--no-deps`` is used to focus on the deps we
  directly pin; if a transitive of one of our deps loses wheel coverage,
  the surface-level dep would too (because pip would fail to resolve).

Usage::

    python scripts/check_wheel_availability.py

Exit codes::

    0  — every (dep, platform, python_version) combination has a wheel
    1  — at least one combination falls back to sdist or fails to resolve
