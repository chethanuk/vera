"""Runtime trap categorisation + stdout-on-trap preservation.

Exercises ``execute()``'s ``except Exception`` branch (in
``vera/codegen/api.py``) and ``cmd_run``'s ``WasmTrapError`` handler
(in ``vera/cli.py``).

Covers two paired bug fixes:

* **#522** — Output written via ``IO.print`` before a runtime trap was
  silently discarded because the captured ``output_buf`` was only
  surfaced on the success path. ``WasmTrapError`` now carries the
  buffer; ``cmd_run`` writes it to ``sys.stdout`` (text mode) or
  includes it in the JSON envelope (JSON mode) before reporting the
  error.

* **#516 (Stage 1)** — Every WASM trap was relabelled
  "Runtime contract violation" by ``cmd_run``'s catch-all. The
  classifier now maps the wasmtime trap reason substring to a stable
  ``kind`` and a Vera-native message; only true contract-host-import
  traps keep the contract-violation label.

Stage 2 (source mapping — the ``frames`` field, v0.0.124) and Stage 3
(per-kind ``Fix:`` paragraphs) have since shipped; their behaviour is
exercised throughout this file.

    ``cmd_run`` flushed the whole buffer to ``sys.stdout`` after
    ``execute()`` returned.  That meant any program using ANSI escape
    sequences (cursor home, clear screen) for animation — Conway's Game
    of Life, progress bars, TUIs, REPL-style output — was invisible
    until exit, at which point the entire transcript flushed in
    microseconds and the terminal processed all of the cursor-home
    escapes faster than a human eye can resolve.  Only the *last*
    frame ended up visible.

    Fix is a tee: ``host_print`` always writes to ``output_buf`` (so
    the trap-preservation contract from #522 still holds), and *also*
    writes to ``sys.stdout`` with an explicit flush per call when

    so an upstream codegen bug producing a corrupt String (ptr, len) pair
    never escapes as a raw Python ``UnicodeDecodeError`` through wasmtime's
    trampoline.

    Triggered in the wild by the captured-Array-indexing-in-closure bug
    (#588) producing corrupt String pointers in a Conway's Game of Life
    program; the user saw a 30+ line Python traceback ending in
    ``UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xc1`` instead
    of a Vera-native runtime trap.  A user-level program should never
    produce a Python traceback regardless of what the program does — this
    is the WasmTrapError contract from #516 / #522 / #547 applied to the
    UTF-8-decode paths.

    The decode invariant now lives in ONE place —
    ``vera.runtime.text.safe_utf8_decode`` (#592) — whose sole direct caller is
    the shared ``_slice_and_decode`` helper (``vera/runtime/heap.py``).  The
    three WASM-memory string readers — ``_read_wasm_string`` and
    ``_read_string_export`` there and markdown ``_read_string`` — all delegate to
    it, as do the host imports that decode user Strings (``host_print`` /
    ``host_stderr`` / ``host_contract_fail``) plus the String-return extractor
    (which route through the readers), so no ``.decode(...)`` call survives
    outside ``_slice_and_decode``.  The unit
    test pins the helper; three end-to-end tests wire the *real* readers through
    a synthetic WAT module and assert no Python ``UnicodeDecodeError`` escapes
    the trampoline (a strict decode would) — which transitively covers the host
    imports / extractor that route through them.  A fourth end-to-end test keeps
    a mirrored ``host_print`` closure to pin the wasmtime-trampoline fact itself
    (that a strict host decode escapes as a "python exception" cause); it does
    not exercise production code, since ``host_print`` now delegates to
    ``_read_wasm_string``.  This centralisation retired the six per-site
    structural source-grep tests that predated it.

    """#591 — network-response decode sites in ``vera/codegen/api.py``
    must not leak Python ``UnicodeDecodeError`` text into Vera-level

    The three sites are siblings of the WASM-memory-decode sites in
    #589 (covered by ``TestHostPrintInvalidUtf8589`` above) but with
    different ergonomics: the bytes here come from a *remote* server,
    not a corrupt-program codegen bug.  A failure here surfaces as a
    Vera-level ``Result::Err`` (via the ``try/except Exception``
    wrappers) rather than a wasmtime-trampoline-wrapped Python
    crash — so the practical impact is "bad error message" rather
    than "Python traceback escapes".  Two strategies in use:

    - ``Http.get`` / ``Http.post`` — ``errors="replace"`` so the user
      gets the response body with U+FFFD substitutions for bad bytes.
      Their intent is "fetch this URL"; preserving data beats
      preserving the (rare) signal that bytes were non-UTF-8.

    - ``Inference.complete`` — explicit ``UnicodeDecodeError`` catch
      that raises a Vera-shaped ``RuntimeError`` ("provider returned
      a response body that is not valid UTF-8 (invalid byte at
      position N)").  Non-UTF-8 from an LLM API is genuinely broken;
      we want loud failure with a Vera-native message, not the
      ``codec can't decode byte 0x...`` Python form.

    Originally discovered (#595) when a user Ctrl-C'd a Conway's Life

    ``host_read_char``'s platform branches) that laundered the
    interrupt into an ``Exception`` the buggy trampoline could catch.

    #599: ``wasmtime-py >= 45.0.0`` catches ``BaseException`
    (bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py#337), so the raw ``KeyboardInterrupt``

        that calls ``IO.sleep(...)``, monkey-patch ``time.sleep`` to
        raise ``KeyboardInterrupt``, run via the production
        ``execute()`` entrypoint, and assert the result surfaces as
        ``ExecuteResult.exit_code == 130`` — not a raw Python
        ``KeyboardInterrupt`` escaping wasmtime's trampoline.

        Exercises the full import/trampoline path: WAT compile →
        wasmtime instance → host_sleep callback (the production
        closure, not a local mirror) → ctypes/ffi → KeyboardInterrupt
        raised inside ``time.sleep`` → wasmtime-py 45's
        ``except BaseException`` trampoline unwinds the wasm call and
        re-raises → caught by ``execute()``'s single
        ``except KeyboardInterrupt`` handler → returned as
        ``ExecuteResult(exit_code=130)``.

        This is the real behavioural contract for #599: it passed both
        before (per-import ``_VeraExit(130)`` guard) and after (central
        handler + ``wasmtime>=45``) the relocation, which is exactly
        why the guard could be removed without changing UX.

        Replaced an earlier local-helper test that mirrored
        ``host_sleep`` in test code and asserted Python's stdlib
        behaviour rather than the production path.  CodeRabbit on
        PR #594 correctly flagged the local-helper form as the same
        "test-the-test" gap that #589's structural-only e2e test had
        — fixing this one symmetrically.

        in flight — no mocking.  The interrupt is raised (via
        `_thread.interrupt_main()`, the in-process equivalent of Ctrl-C)
        only after the server confirms the request arrived, and the
        handler is released immediately after, so the invocation
        `finally`'s `shutdown(wait=True)` has a live worker to wait out.
        The test completing at all pins that teardown doesn't hang; the
        assertions pin the exit-130 mapping.

        #848: the print comes BEFORE the ``async(...)`` — that program
        order is the happens-before making the stdout assertion
        deterministic (buffer write → request issuance → arrival →
        interrupt; the interrupt can never precede the print).  The
        original shape printed between ``async`` and ``await``, which
        races the worker thread's request against the guest reaching
        the print — a lost race yields the correct exit 130 with empty
        stdout (flaked twice on macos-26 runners, PR #846).  Prompt
        (non-blocking) issuance at the ``async`` point is pinned
        separately by the #841 request-ordering and operand-stack
        tests, so nothing is lost by the reorder.

        #848 round 2 (PR #849): server ARRIVAL is produced by the
        executor WORKER thread and says nothing about where the MAIN
        thread is — ``interrupt_main()`` only sets a pending SIGINT
        flag, and firing it before the main thread parks in the
        interruptible ``Future.result()`` wait let the flag
        materialize outside ``execute()``'s protected region on slow
        runners (an xdist worker crash on two macOS jobs; a completed
        run with ``exit_code=None`` on ubuntu — 3/12 jobs at PR #849's
        merge head).  The interrupter therefore also polls
        ``sys._current_frames()`` until the main thread's stack shows
        it blocked inside ``host_async_await`` → ``Future.result``
        before firing, with a bounded deadline so the test can never
        hang; the handler release stays after the interrupt so
        ``shutdown(wait=True)`` still has a live worker to wait out."""
