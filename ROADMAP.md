# Roadmap

Where the project is going.  See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for what's been built and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for per-release detail.

The goal is unchanged: **a stable, working, usable language that doesn't silently fail under the agents using it** — and, on that foundation, the flagship demonstration that an agent can write verified tools in it.

## How this file works

The roadmap is a sequence of **stages** — concentrated sprints over a coherent class of issues — continuing the numbering from [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md), which closed Stage 18.  The v0.1.0 bug burndown (Stage 17) set the model: pick a themed set, drive it to zero as one campaign, release, move on.  When a stage's table empties, the stage moves to HISTORY.md with its releases and the next one starts.

Ordering derives from the design principles ([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)): verification truth first, then structural drift-proofing, then the capabilities the flagship needs, then the experience around them.  Priority lives in this file and nowhere else — issues carry kind and area labels, not priority labels.  Completed items are deleted from these tables and noted in HISTORY.md.  Stages beyond the next one or two are a forecast, not a commitment — they reorder freely as reality intervenes, and a new bug class outranks everything and becomes its own burndown, as Stage 17 did.

## Where we are

6,822 tests, 143 conformance programs, 37 examples, 14 spec chapters.  No known bugs ([KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)); what remains there are *limitations*, and the stages below are how they retire.

## Stage 19 — The verification completeness sprint

*`vera verify` tells the whole truth.*

Zero known bugs does not mean zero known gaps: KNOWN_ISSUES carries a family of verification-completeness limitations — an obligation not emitted, a guard not planted, an instantiation inferred wrong — individually small, sharing machinery, and exactly the shape the burndown model handles well.  [#769](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/769) leads because it is the one open class where a program silently *does the wrong thing* (codegen and the verifier share the wrong instantiation, so nothing disagrees loudly).  The guard wave shares one architectural enabler — per-component target-type metadata in codegen — which unlocks four issues at once.

Exit criterion: every verification-completeness and guard-deferral row in KNOWN_ISSUES is retired.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#769](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/769) | **Monomorphizer type-inference / reindex completeness** — builtin-return table gaps (`string_chars`, `string_split`, …), shallow nested type-argument unification (`Array<Option<T>>` leaves `T` unbound → `Bool` default), parameter-only collapse-reindex.  Shared by codegen and the #732 verifier, so both agree on the wrong instantiation.  The sprint's lead. |
| [#764](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/764) | Call preconditions after an untranslatable `let` / `let`-destructure are not statically checked — `_translate_block` truncates, so E501 never fires though the runtime `requires` guard still holds. |
| [#779](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/779) | Primitive-op obligations (E502/E526/E527) don't recurse into closure / quantifier / handler-clause bodies — fresh-slot scopes the walkers skip. |
| [#909](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/909) | A value's postcondition / refinement is forgotten through an ADT field (box then unbox loses the fact), degrading provable programs to Tier 3. |
| [#758](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/758) | `@Nat` narrowing not obligated at function return position or value-position tuple/constructor components — the static half of the guard-deferral family. |
| [#754](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/754) | Effect-operation-argument runtime guard for `@Nat` narrowing, with a dedicated trap kind — first consumer of the per-component metadata enabler. |
| [#757](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/757) | Generic-instantiated constructor-field runtime guard — second consumer of the same enabler. |
| [#765](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/765) | Nested constructor sub-pattern binds (`Some(Some(@PosInt))`) runtime-guarded to match their static obligation. |
| [#820](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/820) | The `@Nat` → `@Int` widening residuals: tuple / array-element / generic-field coercions guarded (today disclosed as E531 only), and the effect-op / closure / genuine-`@Int`-arm sites obligated at all. |
| [#860](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/860) | Harden the four sibling shadow-stack bounds (WAT `gc_shadow_push` emitter, `$register_wrapper` slow path, browser `gcRooted`/`gcShadowPush`) to the slot-complete form #791 gave `_ShadowGuard.push` — rides here because the WAT sites re-baseline golden pins. |
| [#958](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/958) | Decide and align spec §11.8 with codegen truth: contract guards are always emitted today — either implement tier-aware omission as a deliberate optimisation or fix the spec's promise. |

## Stage 20 — The single-source sprint

*One fact, one home, drift caught by a gate.*

The Stage 18 consistency sweep fixed a long tail of drift **by hand**; this stage makes those classes structural so the next sweep finds nothing.  It inherits the June 2026 audit's second theme and the gate-honesty findings the July external contributions surfaced: a gate that doesn't check its own premise is drift waiting to happen.  The release-process holdouts ride here too — automation is single-sourcing for process.

Exit criterion: each listed drift class has a generator or a gate, and a release requires no manual tag/publish steps.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#735](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/735) | **Builtin dispatch table** — replace the 475-line `_translate_call` if-chain with a `{name: BuiltinSpec}` table, then have checker registration and the spec §9 tables consume it.  The sprint's lead: one table, three consumers. |
| [#828](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/828) | `error_code` uniqueness — one stable code per diagnostic concept, enforced by a collision gate on the registry. |
| [#954](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/954) | Single-source the `E001` example — generate all five doc mirrors from `vera/errors.py` instead of guarding hand-copies. |
| [#955](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/955) | Diagnostic-fields gate: honour `# diag-fields-exempt` in all three passes, or stop advertising it where it does nothing. |
| [#956](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/956) | Diagnostic-fields gate: make the plumbing-skip check its own premise (a delegating helper's hardcoded fields currently go unvalidated). |
| [#683](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/683) | Align spec EBNF and Lark grammar rule names, with a check script to hold the alignment. |
| [#653](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/653) | Spec audit for §0.2 / §0.3 design-principle violations — the spec held to its own principles. |
| [#528](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/528) | Gate the hand-edited numbers on the veralang.dev homepage against live counts (the Stage 18 landing-page audit found this class live). |
| [#540](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/540) | lychee + markdownlint MD051 cross-doc anchor validation. |
| [#481](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/481) | Auto-tag and auto-release on version bump — removes the forgettable manual release steps documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). |
| [#737](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/737) | Document the distribution policy (git-clone now; PyPI `veralang` publication gated on #481). |

## Stage 21 — The effect hardening sprint

*Production controls for the headline effects.*

Before the flagship builds on them, `Http` and `Inference` get the controls real agent workloads need: auth headers, status codes, timeouts and verbs on one side; cost gates, deterministic replays, mocking, and provider breadth on the other.  The Http and Inference control rows are current KNOWN_ISSUES limitations; the provider and example rows are supporting work on the same effect surface.

Exit criterion: the Http and Inference limitation rows are retired; an agent can call an authenticated API and mock the model call in tests.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#351](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/351) | Http: custom request headers (`Authorization` is the blocking case). |
| [#352](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/352) | Http: status-code access — distinguish a 404 from a 500. |
| [#353](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/353) | Http: per-request timeout control. |
| [#356](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/356) | Http: PUT / PATCH / DELETE. |
| [#370](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/370) | Inference: configurable `max_tokens` / `temperature` — cost gates and deterministic replays. |
| [#372](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/372) | Inference: user-defined `handle[Inference]` handlers — mocking, caching, routing. |
| [#373](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/373) | Host-import `Array<Float64>` returns (`alloc_result_ok_float_array`) — the infrastructure #371 needs. |
| [#371](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/371) | `Inference.embed` — vector embeddings, unblocked by #373. |
| [#425](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/425) | Provider: xAI Grok. |
| [#450](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/450) | Provider: DeepSeek V3/R1. |
| [#451](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/451) | Provider: Google Gemini. |
| [#379](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/379) | Example: Inference + JSON composition. |
| [#380](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/380) | Example: handler mocking for Inference (unblocked by #372). |

## Stage 22 — The verified tool server

*The flagship: an MCP tool server whose tool schemas are compile-time guarantees.*

The thesis demo.  The `<HttpServer>` effect, the WASI Preview 2 target, and its `wasi:http` serve backend shipped in the server-effects sprint (Stage 16); Stage 21 hardens the effects it consumes.  What remains is the `<McpServer>` effect itself, the safety rails a server on untrusted input needs, and the small stdlib surface real tools keep reaching for.

Exit criterion: a working MCP tool server written in Vera, serving contract-verified tools to a real agent, with the demo documented end to end.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#306](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/306) | **`<McpServer>` effect** — verified MCP tool server; contracts guarantee tool schemas at compile time.  The flagship use case. |
| [#239](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/239) | Resource limits (fuel, memory, timeout) — essential for untrusted inputs. |
| [#235](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/235) | SHA-256 / HMAC — webhook signatures and API authentication patterns. |
| [#233](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/233) | Date and time handling beyond `IO.time`. |
| [#236](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/236) | CSV parsing and generation. |
| [#440](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/440) | `vera test` ADT input generation — tool payloads are ADTs; testing verified tools needs constructor synthesis. |
| [#401](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/401) | Static MCP documentation endpoint for Vera itself. |
| [#529](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/529) | Use mcp-assert as the test harness for the Vera MCP server. |
| [#329](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/329) | Explore Plumbing integration — Vera WASM modules as verified agent tool calls (the exploration item; this sprint is its trigger). |

## Stage 23 — The agent experience sprint

*The loop the model lives in.*

With the flagship standing, invest in the write–verify–fix loop agents actually experience: the language server's remaining seams, the context tools that keep a project inside a token budget, the discoverability surface, and the evidence base — this is where VeraBench's pass@k re-run lands, measuring whether all of the above moved the number.

Exit criterion: the LSP limitation rows are retired, and a fresh VeraBench run (pass@k, current models) is published.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#724](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/724) | LSP: buffer-aware module resolution (imports currently resolve from disk, not open buffers). |
| [#725](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/725) | LSP: handler-aware `vera/addEffect` propagation bounding. |
| [#181](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/181) | Slot go-to-definition and mechanical slot-index rewriting beyond parameters (`let`/`match` bindings). |
| [#558](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/558) | `--explain-slots` beyond signatures — match arms, W001 holes. |
| [#523](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/523) | `vera context` — token-budgeted project export for agents. |
| [#698](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/698) | `vera shape` — function-archetype histograms per module. |
| [#224](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/224) | REPL — the shortest feedback path is currently `vera run` on a file. |
| [#562](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/562) | `vera test` advanced features — input shrinking, cross-function scenarios, coverage-guided generation. |
| [#143](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/143) | Expand to 50+ examples. |
| [#519](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/519) | SKILL.md documentation gap inventory. |
| [#424](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/424) | Register veralang.dev with llms.txt directories. |
| [#525](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/525) | Close the remaining Agent Score gaps on veralang.dev. |
| [#225](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/225) | VeraBench: pass@k evaluation, more models, more tiers — the sprint's measurement. |

## Stage 24 — The browser sprint

*Demos that move.*

The browser seam was deliberately demoted below correctness work (June 2026); it comes due after the flagship.  One suspend/resume mechanism (JSPI) unblocks the three biggest items — sleep-driven animation, async `fetch`, and (with the ANSI interpreter) terminal-style programs rendering unchanged.

Exit criterion: the browser limitation rows are retired and an animated demo runs on veralang.dev.

| Issue | What |
|---|---|
| [#609](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/609) | `IO.sleep` via JSPI (or Asyncify fallback) so animations don't freeze the tab; unblocks the browser half of `IO.read_char`. |
| [#355](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/355) | Replace sync XHR with `fetch` — every fix option is an async-to-sync bridge, so it shares the JSPI machinery. |
| [#610](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/610) | Minimal ANSI-subset interpreter so terminal-style programs render unchanged. |
| [#603](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/603) | Export string-marshalling helpers so JS can pass `String` arguments into Vera functions. |
| [#349](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/349) | `runtime.mjs` test coverage to >80%, matching the Python-side gate. |

## The horizon

Beyond the staged sprints — grouped by arc, each pulled forward by its trigger, not before.

**Verification depth** — [#427](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/427) Tier 2 verification (Z3 with `assert`/lemma hints; its differential oracle — per-monomorphization results from #732 — has shipped, so this is unblocked but outranked), [#439](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/439) lifting effect-handler bodies out of Tier 3 (research-grade; approach 3 depends on #427), [#686](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/686) `data invariant(...)` clauses (blocked; refinement types are the working alternative).

**Testing depth** — [#795](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/795) mutation testing beyond the soundness core (needs the full-sweep deadlock on mutmut 3.6 / Python 3.14 resolved first), [#792](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/792) feedback-driven hardening for the deep verifier/smt layers, [#170](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/170) Hypothesis as `vera test` generation backend (bookmark; trigger is sustained "cannot generate inputs" warnings).

**Concurrency and WASI** — [#406](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/406) WASI 0.3 native async (gated on wasmtime-py exposing component async), [#853](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/853) extend wasi-p2 beyond IO+Random (Http via `wasi:http` outgoing-handler, streaming filesystem, sockets), [#270](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/270) `handle[Async]` scheduling strategies, [#227](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/227) timeout/cancellation effects, [#228](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/228) WebSocket/SSE, [#770](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/770) non-blocking / timed stdin, [#844](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/844) advisory diagnostic for shape-unfusable `async` arguments.

**Modules and ecosystem** — [#187](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/187) module-qualified call disambiguation → [#127](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/127) module re-exports, [#130](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/130) package system and registry, [#163](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/163) standalone WASM runtime package, [#238](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/238) Component Model interop, [#56](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/56) incremental compilation, [#294](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/294) effect row variable unification, [#785](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/785) GitHits MCP (bookmark; trial at the next dependency-facing milestone).

**Standard library long tail** — [#367](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/367) Markdown extractors, [#368](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/368) HTML accessors, [#507](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/507) ability-dispatched array operations, [#509](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/509) Unicode-aware string built-ins phase 2, [#229](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/229) database effect ([#309](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/309) contract-verified SQL stays blocked behind it).

**Compiler internals** — [#672](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/672) canonical WAT formatter, [#745](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/745) narrow the wrap-table / Phase 2c emission to `decimal_ops_used` only, [#739](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/739) typed `Protocol` interfaces for the mixin mypy carve-outs.

## Ongoing threads

Not stage-gated; advanced alongside whatever stage is active.

- **VeraBench** ([vera-bench](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench)) — the suite is its own thread; the compiler-side pass@k re-run is staged as Stage 23's measurement ([#225](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/225)).
- **CI and process** — [#386](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/386) Hypothesis round-trip properties (bookmark), [#702](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/702) Linux aarch64 CI matrix entry, [#537](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/537) drop the pip-upgrade audit workaround (removal trigger in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md)), [#712](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/712) Codecov → Harness migration watch, [#753](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/753) pygls / Python 3.16 watch.

## Not doing now

Deliberate trade-offs, recorded so they aren't re-litigated by accident.

- **No typed IR for WAT emission.**  The audit floated one; the cost-benefit doesn't clear while string-based emission is held safe by the walker-completeness gate and the planned canonical WAT formatter ([#672](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/672)).
- **No parser fuzzing yet** ([#402](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/402), bookmark).  Trigger: a parser crash from the wild, or spare CI budget.
- **No full Tier 2 verification yet** ([#427](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/427)).  Its old blocker is gone — per-monomorphization verification shipped and provides the differential oracle — but the staged sprints above outrank it; it stays on the horizon by priority, not dependency.

## Speculative

Deferred decisions — features without a current driver, captured so the design analysis isn't re-derived if one shows up.  Promotes into a stage when a real trigger appears.

| Item | Issue | Trigger condition |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Allow `@Byte` arithmetic with verified underflow + overflow guards | [#564](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/564) | A real Vera program (or proposed feature) requires byte arithmetic at the user-code level — e.g., a binary-format parser the stdlib doesn't cover; or VeraBench shows a measurable adoption tax from `byte_to_int` round-trips on byte-heavy benchmarks.  Today: the type checker excludes `Byte` from `NUMERIC_TYPES`, so `@Byte - @Byte` etc. produce E140; the round-trip via `byte_to_int` / `int_to_byte` is the canonical idiom. |
